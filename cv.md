### Hi! My name is Dzmitry Fedchanka
- Easiest way to contact me is [telegram](https://t.me/zm1ca), yet you may wwrite an e-mail to zmicier.fied@yandex.ru
- I do feel extreme passion to creation of new things, such as diy-stuff, ciphers or usefull (or just funny) applications. It's important for me to feel usefullness of any task I do, so I'm usually prefer asking specific questions about any project, mostly to feel the vibe.
- I have some lightweight experience in python and math-oriented C/C++ skill, but lately I've been dedicaating myself to iOS and Swift in particular, so my skillset contains following: git, Foundation, UIKit, CoreData, SwiftLint, SnapKit, Firebase, MVC and MVVM.
- You can find my latest pet-project [here](https://github.com/zm1ca/SKZI-requestAssistant).
- I took part in developing an crypto-secure iOS messenger Bolero and passed a dozen of online-courses, which you can find in my [GitHub](https://github.com/zm1ca?tab=repositories).
